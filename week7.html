						<h3>Objective for Week 7</h3>
						
							<li>Make proto-boards</li>
							<li>Finish consistency check (working on android)</li>
							<li>Changes in battery plan</li>
						</br>
						<h3>Summary of what we did this week</h3>
						<h4>Make a proto-board</h4>
						<p>This week, we started to make proto-boards. </br> 
							Our first attempt was to make it on the smallest proto-board we could get from local store. </br>
							Since we have another set of circuit boards, we have decided to use this first proto-board as a testing board. The picture in below is the first protoboard we made.</p>

						<a><img src="images\week7_proto2.jpg" alt="" height="50%" width="50%"/></a>
						</br>
						<p>We then observed that our components can be built in much smaller proto-board by looking at how much pins we are wasting on the first proto-board. </br>
							We also figured out that our soldering and wiring could be done much better. </br>
							So we decided to make another proto-board with much smaller one provided by our Professor. </br>
							We also used much thinner wires for this time. </p>
						</br>

						<a><img src="images\week7_proto4.jpg" alt="" height="50%" width="50%"/></a>
						</br>	
						<p> As you see the pictures, the new proto-board is only about two quarters big. </p>
						
						<h4>Finish consistency check (working on android)</h4>
						<p> The video below shows the testing sequences we took for our consistency check. </br>
							Before we tested this, we have tested multiple cases and made sure our "Dynamic Time Warping" works properly too. </br>
							We also implemented function on android to give user the consistency score in percentile.</p>

						<h4>Changes in Battery</h4>
						<p> After deeper researches in battery, we decided to use Li-on battery with its charger circuit and switch. </br>
							Following components are the ones we bought in last week and expected to arrive on Tuesday of week 5/18. </br>
							We considered the dimension of battery and charger carefully for our housing plan. </br>
							Deeper analysis is expected to be done after we receive the batteries on Tuesday. </br>

						</br>	
						</p>
						
						
						<h3>Objectives for next week</h3>
						<p>We are going to work on housing plan for our product. </br>
						Before we design our 3d printing model, we first drew the whole proto-board with exact dimension in the unit of millimeters. </br>
						We then designed the sub parts of housing such as the cylinder columns for pushing buttons and spaces for strap on the sides. </br>
						
						We will also make our UI better and keep implmenting simple function in software. </br>
						We have all the working data in matlab and we are trying to convert things to be able to run in android</p>
