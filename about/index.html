	        		<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>
					Based on our initial identification of the problem at hand, we have narrowed the problem down to being able to analyze the speed and motion user's swing, and what happens at the point of impact.
					Using a 3-axis gyroscope, we intend to be able to model the motion of the swing in the 3D plane. This, although a major portion of the assignment at hand, isn't the key factor.
					Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So, when someone strikes a ball either in tennis or golf, or whatever the sport may be, you feel a 'recoil' in your hands. We intend to quantify this recoil.
					For this, we intend to use either an accelerometer or a tilt-ball switch, based on the budget.
					The data collected will then be sent to a paired smartphone via a Bluetooth module.
